# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for the coding boot camp I am attending. It was created prior to the start of class as some prework exercises to briefly cover some topics that will be gone over during the course. It contains notes on different aspects of the course, such as HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
