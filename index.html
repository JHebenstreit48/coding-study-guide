      <h2>HTML</h2>

      <ul>

        <li>
          The head element contains information about the webpage.
        </li>

        <li>
          The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.
        </li>

        <li>
          Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development.
        </li>

        <li>
          HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.
        </li>

        <li>
          It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on
          the web.
        </li>

        <li>
          Elements are used to add content to pages.
        </li>

        <li>
          There are multiple types of elements including: text, image, header, and list.
        </li>

        <li>
          Elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other
          developers.
        </li>

        <li>
          Common types of elements used to divide content are: meta-related, content division, and semantic elements.
        </li>

        <li>
          The "Head" elements contains information or metadata that helps the browser to render the page correctly.
        </li>

        <li>
          The "Body" element contains the content that is show to the user.
        </li>

        <li>
          Any content we want the end user to see and interact with must be placed inside the "Body" element.
        </li>

        <li>The "Doctype html" at the top of the page is considered a "declaration."</li>
        <li>"Declarations" are used to tell the browser what document type it should expect when opened.</li>
        <li>"Doctype" is not case sensitive, but HTML elements are.</li>
        <li>"Metadata" is data about the webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users.</li>
        <li>"Metadata" is not typically seen by users.</li>
        <li>The "style" element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
        <li>The "base" element defines the URL for a webpage.</li>
        <li>The "meta" element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.
        </li>
        <li>The "script" element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
        <li>The "charset" or character set element, sets our character encoding.</li>
        <li>When the attribute is set to "lang="en". This lets us know the page will be in English.</li>
        <li>The "http-equiv" element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
        <li>The "viewport" element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
        <li>The "section" element divides content up into more organized sections based on thematic content.</li>
        <li>The "class" attribute is used to define a </li>
        <li>The "id" attribute is a way to identify elements and select them.</li>
        <li>Using the "ul" tag, creates an "unordered list" of items. This is a bulleted list.</li>
        <li>Using the "ol" tag, creates an "ordered list". This is a numbered list.</li>
        <li>Using the "li" tag, creates a "list item" for an unordered or ordered list.</li>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>

        <li>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets".</li>
        <li>CSS defines how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
        <li>For example it defines things such as: webpage colors, aesthetics, visual, layout, and organization.</li>
        <li>The three ways to style a webpage using CSS are: inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS. </li>
        <li>When using an external CSS style sheet. You use a link element to link the HTML page to a separate CSS file.
        </li>
        <li>When using "external CSS", the link is placed between the HTML files "head" elements.</li>
        <li>A "margin" indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A "padding" indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        <li>The "." that precedes the "card" designates this as a class selector.</li>
        <li>Any HTML element assigned to the class will gain whatever property assignments you defined in your CSS code.
        </li>
        <li>The "bow-shadow" CSS property adds shadow effects around the elements frame.</li>
        <li>Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's "borders, padding, and content." This is
          sometimes referred to as the "CSS box model."</li>

        <li>
          When trying to center something on a page, such as text or an image. It is best to use the <strong>max-width</strong>  and <strong>min-width</strong> commands in addition to the <strong>width</strong> command if you want to really get more precise.

        Steps to Sync Local files with GitHub
      </h2>

      <br>

      <ol>

        <li>
          When you are on or in the <strong><em>main</strong></em> branch <strong>locally</strong>. We have a
          requirement to work on a <strong><em>feature</strong></em> or separate branch.
        </li>

        <li>
          Checkout to a new branch with the git checkout -b <strong>branch name</strong> command.
        </li>

        <ol type="I">

          <li>
            This will create and checkout to the new <strong><em></em>branch name</em></strong>.
          </li>

        </ol>


        <li>
          Do the <strong><em>commit</em></strong> workflow as needed in this stage. This includes
          <strong><em>pushing</em></strong> those <strong>commits</strong> to GitHub.
        </li>

        <ol type="I">
          This means do either <strong>git add .</strong> or <strong>git add -A</strong>.
        </ol>

        <li>
          Sync with GitHub with the <strong>git push</strong> command.
        </li>

        <ol type="I">
          <li>
            Warning this will prompt you with the following suggestion example:
          </li>

        </ol>

        <ol type="i">
          <li>
            <strong>push --set-upstream origin "branch name"</strong>.
          </li>

          <li>
            Now we will have a synced connection between <strong><em>GitHub</em></strong> and our
            <strong><em>local</em></strong> branch.
          </li>

        </ol>

        <li>
          Work on your files/directories <strong><em>locally</em></strong>.
        </li>

        <li>
          Create a <strong>Pull Request (PR)</strong> in GitHub
        </li>

        <li>
          Then do a <strong>Merge Pull Request</strong>.
        </li>

        <li>On the <strong><em>local</em></strong> device. If we are still not in <strong><em>main</em></strong> branch,
          we need to <strong><em>checkout</em></strong>.</li>
        <ol type="I">
          <li>To checkout to the <strong><em>main</em></strong> branch, use the <strong>git checkout main</strong>
            command.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Then we need to bring all the changes living in GitHub remote/main branch to our local machine using the
          <strong>git pull</strong> command.
        </li>
        <li>When you finish, rinse and repeat as needed</li>

      <h2>Javascript</h2>

      <ul>

        <li>A file extensions of ".js" indicates the file as a "JavaScript" file.</li>
        <li>A "variable" is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Before previous changes to Javascript you would use the keyword "var" to create a "variable in your code.
        </li>
        <li>However, you now use "const" to create a "variable".</li>
        <li>In JavaScript a "string" is surrounded by quotation marks.</li>
        <li>The "console.log()" method, allows you to output a message to the web console by adding an "argument".</li>
        <li>The "argument" is put inside the parenthesis that follow "console.log."</li>
        <li>A "JavaScript file is linked inside the "body" element. Whereas, CSS is linked in the "head" element.</li>
        <li>A group of related data in JavaScript is known as an "array".</li>
        <li>"Arrays" are especially useful when you want to perform a task on multiple pieces of data at once.</li>

        <li>
          A <strong>for</strong> loop uses the predictable pattern of "<strong>indices</strong>" to perform a task on all items in an array, by
          allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.
        </li>

        <li>
          A <strong>function</strong>'s name is followed by "<strong>()</strong>".
        </li>

        <li>
          The code for a function is also written inside curly brackets or "<strong>{}</strong>".
        </li>

        <li>
          Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.
        </li>

        <li>
          An <strong>object</strong> in JavaScript is a group of <strong>key value pairs</strong>.
        </li>

        <li>
          In a <strong>key value pair</strong> The <strong>key</strong> is the part before the "<strong>:</strong>" symbol on the left. The part following the "<strong>:</strong>" symbol is the <strong>value</strong>.
        </li>

        <li>
          In the <strong>DevTools</strong> of a browser. The "<strong>{}</strong>" signify an object on the <strong>Console</strong> tab.
        </li>

        <li>
          The "<strong>[]</strong>" on a web broswers <strong>Console</strong> tab indicate the use of an <strong>array</strong>. This is also the case outside of the browser.
        </li>

        <li>
          An <strong>array</strong> can also be considered as a <strong>list</strong> of items that can be added to if need be.
        </li>

        <li>
          An <strong>object</strong> is an example of one item that can have <strong>multiple properties</strong> to it.
