          <li>
            The <span class="emphasis">(head)</span> element contains information about the webpage.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            The <span class="emphasis">(body)</span> element represents the visible content shown to the user.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</span> is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            <span class="emphasis">HTML</span> is used to create the <span class="emphasis">structure</span> of a webpage.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            It is made up of <span>elements</span> which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on
            the web.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            <span>Elements</span> are used to add content to pages.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            There are multiple types of elements including: <span>text, image, header, and list</span>.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            Elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other
            developers.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            Common types of elements used to divide content are: meta-related, content division, and semantic elements.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            The "Head" elements contains information or metadata that helps the browser to render the page correctly.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            The "Body" element contains the content that is show to the user.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            Any content we want the end user to see and interact with must be placed inside the "Body" element.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            The "Doctype html" at the top of the page is considered a "declaration."
          </li>
  
          <li>
            "Declarations" are used to tell the browser what document type it should expect when opened.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            "Doctype" is not case sensitive, but HTML elements are.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            "Metadata" is data about the webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            "Metadata" is not typically seen by users.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            The "style" element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            The "base" element defines the URL for a webpage.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            The "meta" element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            The "script" element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document
          </li>
  
          <li>
            The "charset" or character set element, sets our character encoding.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            When the attribute is set to "lang="en". This lets us know the page will be in English.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            The "http-equiv" element sets an HTTP header for content.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            The "viewport" element sets the default view for our webpage.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            The "section" element divides content up into more organized sections based on thematic content.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            The "class" attribute is used to define one or more classnames for an element.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            The "id" attribute is a way to identify elements and select them.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            Using the "ul" tag, creates an "unordered list" of items. This is a bulleted list.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            Using the "ol" tag, creates an "ordered list". This is a numbered list.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            Using the "li" tag, creates a "list item" for an unordered or ordered list.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            If you put <span>(input type="password")</span> in the HTML file. This will block the password from being viewed as it is typed.

      <div>

        <ul class="list-items">

          <li>
            CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets".
          </li>
  
          <li>
            CSS defines how webpage content is presented to users.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            For example it defines things such as: webpage colors, aesthetics, visual, layout, and organization.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            The three ways to style a webpage using CSS are: inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            When using an external CSS style sheet. You use a link element to link the HTML page to a separate CSS file.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            When using "external CSS", the link is placed between the HTML files "head" elements.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            A "margin" indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            A "padding" indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            The "." that precedes the "card" designates this as a class selector.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            Any HTML element assigned to the class will gain whatever property assignments you defined in your CSS code.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            The "bow-shadow" CSS property adds shadow effects around the elements frame.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's "borders, padding, and content." This is
            sometimes referred to as the "CSS box model."
          </li>
  
          <li>
            When trying to center something on a page, such as text or an image. It is best to use the
            <span>max-width</span> and <span>min-width</span> commands in addition to the <span>width</span>
            command if you want to really get more precise.

        </li>

        <li>
          Checkout to a new branch with the git checkout -b <span>branch name</span> command.

        <li>
          Do the <span><em>commit</em></span> workflow as needed in this stage. This includes

      <ul class="list-items">

        <li>
          JavaScript is a <span>loosely-typed</span> langugage and can be prone to errors in your code.
        </li>

        <li>
          A file extensions of <span>".js"</span> indicates the file as a <span>"JavaScript" file.
        </li>

        <li>
          A "variable" is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.
        </li>

        <li>
          Before previous changes to Javascript you would use the keyword "var" to create a "variable in your code.
        </li>

        <li>
          However, you now use "const" to create a "variable".
        </li>

        <li>
          In JavaScript a "string" is surrounded by quotation marks.
        </li>

        <li>
          The "console.log()" method, allows you to output a message to the web console by adding an "argument".
        </li>

        <li>
          The "argument" is put inside the parenthesis that follow "console.log."
        </li>

        <li>
          A "JavaScript file is linked inside the "body" element. Whereas, CSS is linked in the "head" element.
        </li>

        <li>
          A group of related data in JavaScript is known as an "array".
        </li>

        <li>"Arrays" are especially useful when you want to perform a task on multiple pieces of data at once.</li>

        <li>
          A <span>for</span> loop uses the predictable pattern of "<span>indices</span>" to perform a task on
          all items in an array, by
          allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.
        </li>

        <li>
          A <span>function</span>'s name is followed by "<span>( )</span>".
        </li>

        <li>
          The code for a function is also written inside curly brackets or "<span>{ }</span>".
        </li>

        <li>
          Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.
        </li>

        <li>
          An <span>object</span> in JavaScript is a group of <span>key value pairs</span>.
        </li>

        <li>
          In a <span>key value pair</span> The <span>key</span> is the part before the "<span>:</span>"
          symbol on the left. The part following the "<span>:</span>" symbol is the <span>value</span>.
        </li>

        <li>
          In the <span>DevTools</span> of a browser. The "<span>{ }</span>" signify an object on the
          <span>Console</span> tab.
        </li>

        <li>
          The "<span>[ ]</span>" on a web broswers <span>Console</span> tab indicate the use of an
          <span>array</span>. This is also the case outside of the browser.
        </li>

        <li>
          An <span>array</span> can also be considered as a <span>list</span> of items that can be added to if
          need be.
        </li>

        <li>
          An <span>object</span> is an example of one item that can have <span>multiple properties</span> to it.
        </li>

        <li>
          The <span>.length</span> command specifies the length of an array.
        </li>

        <li>
          If for example you write <span>let studentName = Tonya</span>. Then <span>studentName</span> is the
          <span>variable name</span> and <span>Tonya</span> is the <span>value</span>.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span>Undefined</span> means the variable has not been defined or assigned to anything.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span>Null</span> means the variable was defined as Null.
        </li>

        <li>
          Both <span>Null</span> and <span>Undefined</span> are different ways to say nothing.
        </li>

        <li>
          The <span>modulus, (%)</span> operator is used to find if a number has a remainder. Which in turn can help
          you determine if the number is odd or even.
        </li>

        <li>
          The (<span>==</span>) helps determine if the variables are equal in value, but not by type.
        </li>

        <li>
          The (<span>!=</span>) helps determine if the variables are not equal in value.
        </li>

        <li>
          The (<span>===</span>) checks to see if the two variables are equal in type and value.
        </li>

        <li>
          The (<span>!==</span>) checks to see if the values and types are not equal.
        </li>

        <li>
          The <span>&&</span> operator checks that both expressions are true in value.
        </li>

        <li>
          If you create a <span>while loop</span> everytime the loop ends all previous variables insde the loop are
          refreshed or thrown out. In this situation you can use <span>const</span> instead of <span>let</span>
          You can only do this in a situation when you are not changing the value of the variable anywhere else outside
          of the while loop or are not reassigning the variable anywhere else.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span>JSON.parse</span> is a static method that parses a JSON string, constructing the JavaScript value or object described by the string. An optional reviver function can be provided to perform a transformation on the resulting object before it is returned. In other words, it turns the string back into an object.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span>JSON</span> stands for = JavaScript Object Notation
        </li>

        <li>
          Always remember <span>stringify</span> to <span>set</span> and <span>parse</span> to <span>get</span>.
        </li>

        <li>
          Always use JSON.stringify when doing <span> localStorage.setItem</span> first and then JSON.parse to <span>localStorage.getItem</span> after. 
        </li>

        <li>
          when you <span>setItem</span> it takes a key and a value, while <span>getItem</span> takes just the key.
        </li>

        <li>
          <span>localStorage.clear</span> clears all data from localStorage.
